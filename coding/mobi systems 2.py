"""
There are around 20,000 commercial airports in the world. Given the list of all direct flights, implement a function that can answer the question: given two airports A and B, can one person travel from A to B, with one or multiple connecting flights? Assume that all flights are bi-directional, in that if there is a flight from A to B, there must be one from B to A.

All flights are stored in a N x N boolean matrix: if there is a flight from A to B, then element [Row-A, Column-B] is true.
